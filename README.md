I bloody love org.reflections. I use it in testing all the time, I've even used it in production once or twice. There is one or two things thing that always bothers me though.
- Its a bit complex using the constructor with its vararg untyped optional extra scanners
- Its a bit slow starting, since it builds all its internal indexes at start, scanning things you might not use
- It gives you a transitive dependency to google-guava and jboss-javassist, that you might not want to have
- It doesnt seem to work with jigsaw (java modules)

Im doing this for fun, and maybe there will be someone else who has similar needs as mine.

Therefore, my goals are
- Thread and concurrency safe
- Lazy init of all class discovery
- Zero dependencies
- Simple construction
- Easy to test/mock
- Works with jigsaw out of the box
